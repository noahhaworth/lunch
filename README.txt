This script was made at the request of my coworkers. They are an indecisive bunch, and wanted a program to tell them where to go for lunch. This script was my response to their request. It is open ended enough that you can easily repurpose this script to 'randomly' pick an item from a given set of options. The script stores lists created by the users of possible places to go to in txt files. Each option has its own set of tags attached to it so that the user can filter down the global set of options to more reflect their current appetite. Tags are to be entered in separated by commas. The main menu gives the user several options to add, remove or modify the global list and their prefered selected tags. There is also a secret menu that can be accessed by typing in a predefined password, or by using the master password of '1234'. This secret menu gives more options like backing up lists, purging lists and setting the 'annoyance' settings. This 'annoyance' setting came about based on feedback from my coworkers. They complained that it was too easy for them to simply run the program over and over again indecisively. To counter this, it is possible to set an addition factor and a multiplication factor. If the addition factor is set to '2', the program will only require you to hit 'enter' one time to generate a random item the first time, but if the user decided to generate another item they will have to press 'enter' three times, then five times etc. Likewise if the multiplication factor is set to '2', first they will press 1 time, then 2 times, then 4 times, etc. The default setting is 0 for the addition factor, and 1 for the multiplication factor, but this can be changed in the secret menu.
